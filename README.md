# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple 2D game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls a turtle character that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars, and reach the other side safely.

## How to Play

1. **Setup:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - The game uses the Turtle module, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

2. **Running the Game:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the game by executing the command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys (up) to control the movement of the turtle.
   - avoid the moving cars while crossing the road.
   - The game ends if the turtle collides with a car or successfully crosses all lanes.

4. **Scoring:**
   - Gain points for each successful crossing.
   - The game gets progressively harder as you advance, with more cars and faster speeds.

5. **Game Over:**
   - The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
   - Your score will be displayed at the end of the game.
